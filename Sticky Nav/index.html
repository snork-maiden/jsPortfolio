      <p>
        There were once a man and a woman <br />who had long in vain wished for
        a child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her
        desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from
        which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most
        beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall,
        and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress,
        who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.
      </p>
      <img
        class="tale__image"
        src="img/Rapunzel1.jpg"
        alt="Rapunzel's parents"
      />
      <p>
        One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the
        garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful
        rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for
        it, and had the greatest desire to eat some.
      </p>
      <p>
        This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get
        any of it, she quite pined away, and looked pale and miserable. Then her
        husband was alarmed, and asked, “What ails you, dear wife?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah,” she replied, “if I can’t get some of the rampion, which is in the
        garden behind our house, to eat, I shall die.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The man, who loved her, thought, “Sooner than let mu wife die, I will
        bring her some of the rampion myself, let it cost me&nbsp;what it will.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In the twilight of evening, he clambered down over the wall into the
        garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and
        took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it
        with much relish.&nbsp;She, however, liked it so much so very much, that
        the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was
        to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again; but when
        he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the
        enchantress standing before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How can you dare,” said she with angry look, “to descend into my garden
        and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah,” answered he, “let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up
        my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the
        window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she
        had not got some to eat.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him,
        “If the case be as you sayest, I will allow you to take away as much
        rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the
        child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well
        treated, and I will care for it like a mother.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was
        brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the
        name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun. When she
        was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay
        in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a
        little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself
        beneath this, and cried,
      </p>
      <img
        class="tale__image tale__image--right"
        src="img/Rapunzel2.jpg"
        alt="Rapunzel in her tower"
      />

      <p>
        “Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br />
        Let down your hair to me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she
        heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,
        wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair
        fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a year or two, it came to pass that the King’s son rode through
        the forest and went by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so
        charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her
        solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King’s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the
        tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so
        deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and
        listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw
        that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br />
        Let down your hair.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress
        climbed up to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my
        fortune,” said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went
        to the tower and cried,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br />
        Let down your hair.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately the hair fell down and the King’s son climbed up.<br />
        At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes
        had never yet beheld, came to her; but the King’s son began to talk to
        her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred
        that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him
        for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she
        thought, “He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does;” and she said
        yes, and laid her hand in his.
      </p>
      <p>
        She said, “I will willingly go away with thee, but I do not know how to
        get down. Bring with thee a skein of silk every time that you come, and
        I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend,
        and you wilt take me on your horse.”
      </p>
      <img
        class="tale__image"
        src="img/Rapunzel3.jpg"
        alt="Prince climbing to the tower"
      />

      <p>
        They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening,
        for the old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this,
        until once Rapunzel said to her, “Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens
        that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young King’s son
        he is with me in a moment.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Ah! thou wicked child,” cried the enchantress, “What do I hear thee
        say! I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have
        deceived me!”
      </p>
      <p>
        In her anger she clutched Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them
        twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and
        snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.
        And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where
        she had to live in great grief and misery.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the enchantress in
        the evening fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off to the
        hook of the window, and when the King’s son came and cried,
      </p>
      <p>
        “Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<br />
        Let down thy hair,”<br />
        she let the hair down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The King’s son ascended, but he did not find his dearest Rapunzel above,
        but the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Aha!” she cried mockingly, “You wouldst fetch your dearest, but the
        beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it,
        and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you; you
        will never see her again.”
      </p>
      <img
        class="tale__image tale__image--right"
        src="img/Rapunzel4.jpg"
        alt="Rapunzel and the Prince"
      />

      <p>
        The King’s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt
        down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which
        he fell, pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the
        forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing but lament
        and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the
        desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a
        boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed
        so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached,
        Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could
        see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully
        received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and
        contented.
